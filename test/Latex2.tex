\section{Equation}
In this template you have the equation environment in latex. It is an alternative for the math mode but with a larger scope. Moreover, in the equation mode we have the label command that adds a label for each equation that you can later use to reference an equation. \\
\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
2x-5y=8
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eq2}
f(x)=x^2
\end{equation}

\section{Errors}
In latex you cant have a backslash within a text, otherwise, it will cause an error as undefined control sequence. In this milestone you have to include the line number that caused the error in the error message. \errorcoming
